Helm is the Kubernetes native package manager, it allows to install and manage applications in Kubernetes without the need to deploy multiple resource files. In this first scenario, we will learn how to install and upgrade [Jenkins] - a widely adopted open source automation server - (https://www.jenkins.io/) from its public [Helm chart](https://github.com/jenkinsci/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/jenkins). We will also learn how to interact with the Helm client to check the status of our applications, which applications are deployed in our cluster, etc.
