## Congratulations! You have completed both Helm tutorials!

## Summary:

In this scenario, you:

1. Learned some of the basic components needed to deploy an application in Kubernetes.
2. Learned how to create a basic Helm chart using those files.
3. Learned how to add variables to a Helm chart in case you need to deploy to multiple environments.
4. Observed how Helm provides easier management for applications that can be composed of several resources without the need to keep track of multiple YAML files.


**Please take this [quiz](https://forms.gle/fEPAdta7CAA1JGgY8) to validate your knowledge about Helm. Also, please provide me [feedback](http://peersurvey.cc.gatech.edu/gt/0693ecae6b1948558356dd8fbc3e4579) to improve these tutorials.**
